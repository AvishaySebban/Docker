#===Creating SSH service with Dokerfile===

1. docker build -t thakker-sshd .
2.Afther imags was downloded and we gave it a tag, now we would like to run the image as a container.

docker run -d -P thakker-shhd #(-d deamon -P open all ports, also the CMD in docker file will run)

 now we will run docker ps 
 ssh root@ip_docker -p <port> and pass like we wnar in Dockerfile CMD

#===Creating an SSH service by commiting a container ===
docker images #choose ubuntu

docker run -i -t -p 22 ubuntu:14.04 /bin/bash

#which ssh or which ssh not installed so we are going to install
apt-get update && apt-get install openssh-server -y

#type passwrod
#edit the conf file of ssh /etc/ssh/sshd_config
2 thing need to changed:
a.one is to set Premotlogin to = yes.
b.second is all the way to the botton UsePam=No.

service ssh start

#Now we commting to our image

docker commit <name of our container (ssh-serv)> <name of the image thakker/ubuntu-sshd:14.04>

docker images

#===Mapping specific ports to containers===
